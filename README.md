### Usage

##### Atom

Nox has an Atom syntax theme. To add it, download the `src/atom/Nox.less` file and link it as a syntax theme.

##### iTerm

Nox has a beautiful iTerm color scheme. To add it, download the `src/iterm/Nox.itermcolors` file and add it as a color preset in iTerm.

##### ZSH (oh-my-zsh)

Nox has a minimal oh-my-zsh theme that displays the current working directory and git status (if in a working git directory). To add it, download the `src/zsh/Nox.zsh-theme` file to the oh-my-zsh themes directory (`~/.oh-my-zsh/themes`). After that, set `ZSH_THEME` to `"Nox"` in your `.zshrc` file.
